# Bamazon


I have created an app using MySql and javascript to create an Amzon like store front.  There are some dependencies that are needed to get the program to run.  Follow the steps below to start after cloning repo.

Steps to run:

1. npm install
2. commands
3. node bamazon_cust.js
4. node bamazon_man.js

When you run the customer version you will be prompted with items that are in stock and available to buy.  Enter the ID for the item you would like to purchase.  Next, you will be asked how many you would like.  Finally, your total will be displayed and a question asking if you would like anything else.  If you choose yes you will cycle thru the questions again if you enter no then your session will end.

If you would to manage the inventory then you can choose to run the manager file.  Instead of buying items you will be prompted to view the items in stock along or to add stock.  By viewing the items you will be shown the quanity, departments, and cost of each item.  You can add additional departments along with new items by following the prompts.
